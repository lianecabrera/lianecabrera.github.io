    <h3>Winter 2016</h3>
    <p>We were given an assignment to make an index revolving around the theme 'winter escape'. We were given full control over the aspect of design and content. Through this project, we were able to learn about the importance of mobile responsiveness as well as understanding the need for adjusting our sites for print. </p>
    <p>I was able to gain a lot from this project. Along with learning how to create a mobile responsive website and how to adjust for print, I was able to further understand develop my aesthetic when it comes to my designs.</p>

    <h3>Winter 2016</h3>
    <p>In our winter PBL, we were placed in groups and were given the task to create an app on MIT App Inventor. Along with creating an app, we had to be able to teach middle schoolers how to create it. In order to do so, we had to create an app that was both interesting and easy enough to code  and follow along.</p>
    <p>This was a really interesting project to participate in. I was  lacking in my knowledge of MIT App Inventor in the beginning of this project but I have a much better understanding of how the program works now. I also had to constantly keep in mind who our target audience was while we were designing the app and the demostration.</p>

    <h3>Fall 2016</h3>
    <p>As a project, we were placed in groups and participated in the Congressional App Challenge. We decided to make a game that was targeted to children to help them learn about the environment around them and eco-friendly activities such as recycling and picking up trash from beaches.</p>
    <p>This project gave me my first experience with MIT App Inventor and it also gave me more experience when it came to collaborating with a team and time management. We chose to create a visual heavy game, which means we had to have a balance between making graphics and coding to work. Although we didn’t make a complete game in time, we were able to design three levels as well as a demo video to show how the game is supposed to work.</p>

    <h3>Fall 2016</h3>
    <p>This project tested us on our Javascript abilities by having us create a quiz that responded through Javascript.</p>
    <p>This project was very challenging for us because we weren't experienced with Javascript but I have definitely have a better grasp at it then I did previously. I am more confident in my Javascript skills after this project.</p>

    <h3>Spring 2016</h3>
    <p>For this project, we teamed up with the Spanish classes and created a tourist/travel website using the research they compiled of their chosen country. The country we were given was Chile.</p>
    <p>I'm really proud of how the final product turned out. Although we were not able to incorporate everything we had planned, we were able to design it in a way that was aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly, and informative. This was also our first experience with usability testing.</p>

    <h3>Winter 2015</h3>
    <p>In my sophomore year, we had taken an in-depth approach to learning HTML and CSS by creating our first portfolios. We learned many different techniques through this, such as embedding videos and images, styling a nav with css, and whatnot.</p>
    <p>Looking back at my first portfolio, I can tell that I've definitely improved, both coding-wise and design-wise.</p>

    <h2 id="ads">Chile Ads</h2>
    <h3>Spring 2016</h3>
    <p>In connection to our collaboration with the Spanish classes to create a website, we created ads to be featured in the website that were going to be animated in Adobe Flash and implemented through Javascript.</p>
    <p>We were unsuccessful in adding our advertisements to our website mainly because we had no previous knowledge of Javascript at this time. However, we did have the chance for each team member to create 3 individual ads.</p>
        
        
    <h2 id="tokyo">Tokyo Project</h2>
    <h3>Spring 2016</h3>
    <p>For this project, we were given a chance to work with some students in Tokyo to give a go at animating the stories they had sent to us. We had to create storyboards, original art, voice acting, and the animations using Adobe Flash.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, we were unable to continue with the production of the animations due to legal matters, but it was still a fun experience. Our teacher had even invited storyboarders and animators to talk to us about how to storyboard/animate and gave us tips on our individual stories that helped us learn a lot.</p>          
        
        
    <h2 id="tourguide">Chile Tour Guide</h2>
    <h3>Spring 2016</h3>
    <p>In connection to our collaboration with the Spanish classes to create a website, we also had a hand in developing a sort of tour guide that we had planned to animate and show the user the different parts of the webpage.</p>
    <p>Although we were not given the chance to implement the tour guide, I was still able to create a few models of how my tour guide was going to look and be positioned for the different pages of the site. I really had to think of not only the design aspect of my tour guide, but also the usability because of the level of interactions it was going to have with the visitors of the site.</p>          
        
    <h2 id="selfportrait">Self-Portrait</h2>
    <h3>Winter 2014</h3>
    <p>Using our knowledge of Adobe Illustrator, we were given the task to create a self-portrait. We were given a generous amount of time and lots of progress checks with advice to make our portraits more realistic.</p>
    <p>This really tested our skills on Illustrator, and looking back at it now,  I have even more knowledge now than I did freshman year and I could recreate this portrait to look better. I am proud of this work because I did my best and used all the skills that was taught to me and was able to learn some secrets from Illustrator that I didn't know previously.</p>  
        
    <h2 id="pro">Winter Break Sketch</h2>
    <h3>Winter 2014</h3>
    <p>After coming back from our first winter break of freshman year, we were given a short project to draw what we did during winter break using a program of our choice. I chose to use Sketchbook Pro because I was unfamiliar with the program and wanted to learn how to use it.</p>
    <p>Although this was a quick project, it helped me gain knowledge of Sketchbook Pro very easily. It was also interesting to see what everyone else in the class created and how they all differed.</p>        
        
    <h2 id="care">Care Package</h2>
    <h3>Fall 2014</h3>
    <p>In our Freshman Studies class, we were given the chance to create care packages for homeless children and decorate it based on a theme. My group chose the theme 'fairytales' and we provided them a decorated chest full of food and amenities, Little Red Riding Hood's red hood to keep them warm, and a coloring book filled with children's fairytales.</p>
    <p>I had a lot of fun brainstorming and creating all the designs for the care package. This project also gave me more awareness of the world around me and the things other people go through and things they don't have that I take for granted.</p>

    <h3>Winter 2015</h3>
    <p>In our Biology class, we were given the task to gather research of a certain genetic trait, to make a hypothesis of how frequently it appears, and to test our hypothesis by conducting a survey of the school population. My main job was to write the research paper after my group gathered the findings.</p>
    <p>This was a very interesting project. I was able to learn about the organized way the research is conducted and the different ways that it could be presented.</p>
